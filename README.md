[00:32.80] Nobody knows what have happened
[00:48.30] 
[00:53.46] There's no way out
[01:02.46] 
[01:10.52] You don't see at all
[01:16.08] What's right for you to do
[01:21.61] Well, let's start and now
[01:25.67] Take a deep breath
[01:34.67] 
[01:29.89] You're moving forward
[01:37.29] Deciding not to look back
[01:39.87] Your weakness is your greatest strength
[01:48.01] You make it to the end
[01:51.04] You'll see you won't be alone
[02:05.54] 
[02:22.01] You will know it's the right place to be
[02:28.22] Don't be afraid to fall
[02:33.98] 'Cause the world will take you
[02:35.61] You can trust them with all your heart
[02:38.26] You will find that you can do anything
[02:44.25] You do the way as it should
[02:50.25] 'Cause they make you ready
[02:51.96] You can do it, you are the one
